# Employee-Atrrition-using-data-mining-techniques
Predicting the attrition or churn rate in an organization based on the employee features like age, income, work experience, post in the company etc. For this prediction, I used the fictional dataset created by the IBM Data Scientists. Different data mining techniques like Random Forest, Decision Trees Logistic Regression, SVM and Gradient Boosted Classifier were used for predicting the attrition rate. Also, during the implementation of the project there was a class imbalance problem which I rectified using over sampling and under sampling on the training test samples.
